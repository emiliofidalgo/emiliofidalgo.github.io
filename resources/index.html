<h4 class="title-und">OBINDEX - Online Binary Image Index</h4>
<p class="text-justify">
OBINDEX is an open source C++ library for indexing images. It implements a hierarchical indexing scheme to match binary descriptors, which is used as an incremental Bag-Of-Words (BoW) visual vocabulary. This index is combined with an inverted file in order to provide an image database, that can be queried for finding similar images. This online binary visual vocabulary tries to solve the main drawbacks that classical BoW approaches present, avoiding the training step and adapting the visual dictionary to the operating environment.

These datasets were recorded around a building at the <a href="http://www.uib.es">University of the Balearic Islands</a> and can be used to assess the quality of visual loop closure algorithms. If you use them, please cite:

Each file contains:
<ul>
	<li>A directory called <em>images</em>. This directory includes an ordered sequence of images in PNG format. The size of the images is 300x240 and they were acquired at 1Hz.</li><br>
	<li>A ground truth file in Matlab format, <em>groundtruth.mat</em>. This file includes a binary matrix where entry (<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) is 1 if image <em>i</em> and image <em>j</em> can be considered as the same place, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the <em>i</em>-th row represents the possible loop closures for image <em>i</em>. This ground truth was generated manually, and perhaps it should be modified if you want to use it as a reference.</li>
