The ROBINS project aims at filling the technology and regulatory gaps that today still represent a barrier to the adoption of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) in activities related to inspection of ships, understanding end userâ€™s actual needs and expectations and analyzing how existing or near-future technology can meet them. ROBINS aims to improve the ability of RAS in sensing and probing, in navigation and positioning in confined spaces, as well as the capability to access and move safely within hazardous spaces. ROBINS also aims to provide new software tools for image and data processing, e.g. for production of 3D models and virtual/augmented reality environments, to provide the surveyor with the same level of information as obtained by direct human observation. A framework for the assessment of equivalence between the outcomes of RAS-assisted inspections and traditional procedures will also be provided by defining test procedures, criteria and metrics for the evaluation of RAS performance. Test campaigns will be performed both on-board and in a specific testing facility, where repeatable tests and measurements can be carried out. The development of robust technical solutions and a regulatory framework for RAS-assisted ship inspection is expected to streamline wide scale adoption of RAS technology in marine industry. The impact on safety, as far as hazardous environments are involved, can be easily understood and has already been witnessed in similar industrial domains (energy, oil and gas). The economic impact is expected to be beneficial for robotics industry (new supply chains and new potential markets), ICT industry (new services and products for data processing specific to marine industry), ship asset owners and operators (reduction of costs due to simplified preparation of items, reduced survey duration, improved quality and variety of inspection services) and certification bodies (new certification schemes for equipment, operators and procedures).

In the day-to-day ship operations, structural and machinery failures may lead to major accidents, endangering crew and passengers lives onboard, posing a threat to the environment, damaging the ship itself and having a great impact in terms of business losses. Moreover, with the introduction and building of a big number of new ships, their monitoring and inspection from both regulatory bodies and Classification Societies has become more and more difficult in order to obtain the optimum inspection results and eliminating the hazards pose by high-risks and sub-standard ships. In this respect, the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) project brings together a range of experienced and dedicated partners in order to tackle the issue of ship inspection, identification of high-risk ships, providing access to information related to ship surveys independent of the ship's flag and inspection regime and moreover incorporate enhanced and harmonised cooperation and maritime stakeholders in order to avoid ship accidents, promote maritime safety and protect the environment. The INCASS consortium aims to bring an innovative solution to the ship inspection regime through the introduction of enhanced inspection of ship structures based on robotic platforms, providing ship structures and machinery monitoring with real time information using 'intelligent' sensors and incorporate Structural and Machinery Risk Analysis. Moreover, by introducing Condition Based Inspection tools and methodologies, reliability and critically based maintenance, providing an enhanced Central Database including ship structures and machinery available to maritime authorities (e.g. EMSA, Port State Control), Classification Societies and ship operators and eventually by developing a Decision Support System for ship structures and machinery for continuous monitoring and risk analysis and management of ship operations.

The increasing competitiveness in marine operations creates a need for new system concepts that introduce high technology value added products, facilitate the processes involved and minimize the downtimes. The need, thus, lies not only in incorporating the technological means so far available, but in changing the way the corresponding authorities stand against the challenges at hand.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
MINOAS project proposes reengineering of the overall vessel-inspection methodology, by introducing an innovative system concept that incorporates state of the art technologies, but at the same time formulates a new standardization of the overall inspection process. Through holistic approach, MINOAS proposes the development of a new infrastructure that substitutes human personnel by high locomotion enabled robots and "teleports" the human inspector from the vessel's hold to a control room with virtual reality properties. The human's perceptual abilities are enhanced through the utilization of high resolution tools (eg. sensors) and are augmented through the parallel processing property provided by MINOAS. Following the centralized control scheme adopted in similar distributed control methodologies (SCADA), the number and the sequence of the tasks required is rearranged and the overall inspection procedure is brought in alignment with the current tendency adopted in similar inspection, exploration and surveillance tasks.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
The proposed innovative system concept, considers the assembly of a robot fleet with advanced locomotion abilities and sets of tools that are dedicated to the tasks attached to the inspection process, the development of control techniques and algorithms that provide a semi-autonomous nature to the operation of the robot-fleet and a hierarchical controller that realize the virtual environment for the human inspector and adds newly developed toolboxes enabling on-line processing of the harvested data and operate as a Decision Support System in the aid of the inspector.

The TRITON research project pursues the use of autonomous vehicles in the accomplishment of complex underwater intervention tasks. The project will emphasize the operation of multiple vehicles (an AUV and an I-AUV) cooperating in a coordinate manner during the execution of a mission, as well as in increasing the dexterity of a robotic arm (currently under development in the context of the RAUVI project), that will be installed in the I-AUV.</p>

<h4>SUPERION - Optical Systems for Enhanced Underwater Perception and Intervention</h4>

SUPERION is the UIB subproject of MERBOTS project. The other subprojects are ARCHROV, leaded by the University of Girona and MERMANIP, conducted by the University Jaume I, the coordinator of the project. MERBOTS is the natural evolution of RAUVI and TRITON projects. Even though both projects have led to a significant progress regarding all their challenging objectives, a serious advancement is needed regarding the robustness and the reliability of the corresponding systems, to achieve the perception capabilities required by the new scenario. The project focuses on underwater archeology, although the same technologies could be applied to other scenarios. Two distinctive missions have been envisioned: the first one, cooperative survey, consists in an autonomous survey of a predefined search area by means of an AUV assisted by a surface vehicle that provides absolute localization and communication; the second mission, a cooperative intervention, entails a semi-autonomous intervention by means of an HROV assisted by an AUV providing out-of-body views of the intervention. The UIB, leading the SUPERION subproject, is responsible for work packages centered on collecting optical data and providing 3D models of the area under study and seeking and modeling potential targets within the sensor data to assist the HROV operator. Thus, SUPERION focuses on two general objectives: enhance 3D reconstruction capabilities for underwater environments by means of optical sensors and improve target detection methods using multimodal sensor data. More specific sub-objectives stemming from the abovementioned are: (1) develop new stereo-SLAM methods to improve the self-localization capabilities of underwater vehicles and, thus, accurately derive the camera poses; (2) enhance 3D reconstruction methods able to deal successfully with the difficulties of underwater scenarios for both full scenes and targets; (3) develop new laser-based 3D modeling algorithms capable of underwater operation for increasing the level of detail at certain places of the environment, particularly the target area; (4) deal with multiple sensor modalities for improved scene modeling; (5) approach target detection in multimodal maps; (6) develop new target tracking methods making use of both 3D and visual-appearance models.
