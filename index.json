By combining the survey capabilities of autonomous Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) and small Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), with teams of magnetic-wheeled crawlers operating directly on the surface of the structure, the project inspection and cleaning system will be able to seamlessly merge the acquisition of a global overview of the structure with performing a detailed multi-robot visual and acoustic inspection of the structure, detecting corrosion patches or cleaning the surface as necessary – all of this with minimal user intervention. The detailed information provided will be integrated into a real-time visualization and decision-support user-interface taking advantage of virtual reality technologies. Although ships are the targetted application, BUGWRIGHT2 technology may be easily adapted to different structures assembled out of metal plates, and in particular to storage tanks, our secondary application domain. The project consists of a large consortium bringing together not only the technological knowledge from academia but the complete value chain of the inspection robotic market: two SMEs, one class society to evaluate the use of these technologies in the certification processes, a marine service provider and two harbors to provide access to ships, one shipyard to deploy the system within a maintenance framework and two shipowners. In addition, specialists in maritime laws and workplace psychologists will ensure that the digitalization of this market sector is designed around user acceptance. Finally, a specialist in innovation will lead the dissemination and exploitation activities.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"3b45370ed9a0a595e505247fbe2e889a","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/bugwright2/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bugwright2/","section":"project","summary":"Autonomous Robotic Inspection and Maintenance on Ship Hulls and Storage Tanks","tags":["h2020"],"title":"BUGWRIGHT2","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Joan P Company-Corcoles","Alberto Ortiz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543918,"objectID":"3db58bd26904481611ccb8062b2604a5","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/garcia-2020-evaluation/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:38.375269Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2020-evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation of a Skill-based Control Architecture for a Visual Inspection-oriented Aerial Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joan P.

On the other side, indistinguishability operators provide a degree of such a similarity extending the notion of equivalence class to the fuzzy context. In the literature, one can find that the development of both mathematical frameworks is carried out independently and assuming that both notions are unrelated, since fuzzy metrics involve a parameter in its formulation and indistinguishability operators do not. The concept of modular indistinguishability operator, which involves a parameter in its formulation, has been introduced recently. This new kind of operator has allowed unifying under the same framework the aforesaid apparently unrelated fuzzy notions of measuring. This opens a wide range of possibilities which are totally unexplored from both the theoretical and applied viewpoints.\nThe main theoretical target of the project is to study what properties of fuzzy metrics and indistinguishability operators remain valid in the general framework of modular indistinguishability operators and, thus, try to make clear the differences with the results coming from the two classical frameworks. The extension to the modular context of all topological results for fuzzy metrics and all results of structure and representation for indistinguishability operators will be addressed. Moreover, this viewpoint will help us transfer, to the indistinguishability context, typical results that only could be stated in the fuzzy metric context, and vice versa. Moreover, applications of the new developed results to fixed point theory are expected to be given in such a way that fixed point results in the context of fuzzy metrics will be retrieved as a particular case. Furthermore, relationships between aggregation theory, generalized metric structures and modular indistinguishability operators are also an objective of the theoretical approach of the project.\nRegarding the application of the theoretical results, the FUZZYMAR project aims at developing new techniques and algorithms that involve the use of modular indistinguishability operators as similarity measures in: (1) addressing two recurring problems in general robotics, namely robust model fitting and (visual) descriptors comparison and matching, both with also application to computer vision and pattern recognition, and (2) modelling multi-robot systems adopting swarm techniques, to deepen in the analysis of their performance and accordingly devise better coordinated task execution strategies.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"aa63d235571b636f53d2835b06c38288","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/fuzzymar/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fuzzymar/","section":"project","summary":"Fuzzy Metrics and Indistinguishability Operators: Applications to Robotics","tags":["national"],"title":"FUZZYMAR","type":"project"},{"authors":["Rihem El Euch","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Alberto Ortiz","Ferdaous Chaabane","Adel Ghazel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543917,"objectID":"c6d35bc032282003bcbbfc2e6425d431","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/el-2019-superpixel/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:37.797396Z","relpermalink":"/publication/el-2019-superpixel/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Superpixel Description and Indexing for Visual Loop Closure Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortiz","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Joan P.

ROBINS aims to improve the ability of RAS in sensing and probing, in navigation and positioning in confined spaces, as well as the capability to access and move safely within hazardous spaces. ROBINS also aims to provide new software tools for image and data processing, e.g. for production of 3D models and virtual/augmented reality environments, to provide the surveyor with the same level of information as obtained by direct human observation. A framework for the assessment of equivalence between the outcomes of RAS-assisted inspections and traditional procedures will also be provided by defining test procedures, criteria and metrics for the evaluation of RAS performance. Test campaigns will be performed both on-board and in a specific testing facility, where repeatable tests and measurements can be carried out. The development of robust technical solutions and a regulatory framework for RAS-assisted ship inspection is expected to streamline wide scale adoption of RAS technology in marine industry. The impact on safety, as far as hazardous environments are involved, can be easily understood and has already been witnessed in similar industrial domains (energy, oil and gas). The economic impact is expected to be beneficial for robotics industry (new supply chains and new potential markets), ICT industry (new services and products for data processing specific to marine industry), ship asset owners and operators (reduction of costs due to simplified preparation of items, reduced survey duration, improved quality and variety of inspection services) and certification bodies (new certification schemes for equipment, operators and procedures).\n","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"a643fec6720522adf360b9738138e23d","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/robins/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/robins/","section":"project","summary":"RObotics technology for INSpection of ships","tags":["h2020"],"title":"ROBINS","type":"project"},{"authors":["Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Alberto Ortiz","E Garcia-Fidalgo"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543918,"objectID":"a79903bfde581a43d68afd7b25e12523","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/bonnin-2018-turning/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:37.987967Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bonnin-2018-turning/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Turning a MAV into an Effective Tool for Vessel Inspection through a Reconfigurable Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antoni Burguera","Francisco Bonin-Font","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543914,"objectID":"acad75f3a35cd55d4bd2a7ae01d43a88","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/burguera-2017-building/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:34.573074Z","relpermalink":"/publication/burguera-2017-building/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Building Large-Scale Coverage Maps of Posidonia Oceanica using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortiz","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Joan Pep Company-Córcoles"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543915,"objectID":"42c1e202a30332a3b440a4e62269f2fb","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/ortiz-2017-defect/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:35.174801Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2017-defect/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Defect-level Inspection Aids for Automated Vessel Visual Inspection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Period: 2017 -

The other subprojects are ARCHROV, leaded by the University of Girona and MERMANIP, conducted by the University Jaume I, the coordinator of the project. MERBOTS is the natural evolution of RAUVI and TRITON projects. Even though both projects have led to a significant progress regarding all their challenging objectives, a serious advancement is needed regarding the robustness and the reliability of the corresponding systems, to achieve the perception capabilities required by the new scenario. The project focuses on underwater archeology, although the same technologies could be applied to other scenarios. Two distinctive missions have been envisioned: the first one, cooperative survey, consists in an autonomous survey of a predefined search area by means of an AUV assisted by a surface vehicle that provides absolute localization and communication; the second mission, a cooperative intervention, entails a semi-autonomous intervention by means of an HROV assisted by an AUV providing out-of-body views of the intervention. The UIB, leading the SUPERION subproject, is responsible for work packages centered on collecting optical data and providing 3D models of the area under study and seeking and modeling potential targets within the sensor data to assist the HROV operator. Thus, SUPERION focuses on two general objectives: enhance 3D reconstruction capabilities for underwater environments by means of optical sensors and improve target detection methods using multimodal sensor data. More specific sub-objectives stemming from the abovementioned are: (1) develop new stereo-SLAM methods to improve the self-localization capabilities of underwater vehicles and, thus, accurately derive the camera poses; (2) enhance 3D reconstruction methods able to deal successfully with the difficulties of underwater scenarios for both full scenes and targets; (3) develop new laser-based 3D modeling algorithms capable of underwater operation for increasing the level of detail at certain places of the environment, particularly the target area; (4) deal with multiple sensor modalities for improved scene modeling; (5) approach target detection in multimodal maps; (6) develop new target tracking methods making use of both 3D and visual-appearance models.\n     ","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"4a2295e79beb04653fd7f36cf670462a","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/superion/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/superion/","section":"project","summary":"Optical Systems for Enhanced Underwater Perception and Intervention","tags":["national"],"title":"SUPERION","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Alberto Ortiz","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Joan P.

Moreover, with the introduction and building of a big number of new ships, their monitoring and inspection from both regulatory bodies and Classification Societies has become more and more difficult in order to obtain the optimum inspection results and eliminating the hazards pose by high-risks and sub-standard ships. In this respect, the INCASS (Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety) project brings together a range of experienced and dedicated partners in order to tackle the issue of ship inspection, identification of high-risk ships, providing access to information related to ship surveys independent of the ship\u0026rsquo;s flag and inspection regime and moreover incorporate enhanced and harmonised cooperation and maritime stakeholders in order to avoid ship accidents, promote maritime safety and protect the environment. The INCASS consortium aims to bring an innovative solution to the ship inspection regime through the introduction of enhanced inspection of ship structures based on robotic platforms, providing ship structures and machinery monitoring with real time information using \u0026lsquo;intelligent\u0026rsquo; sensors and incorporate Structural and Machinery Risk Analysis. Moreover, by introducing Condition Based Inspection tools and methodologies, reliability and critically based maintenance, providing an enhanced Central Database including ship structures and machinery available to maritime authorities (e.g. EMSA, Port State Control), Classification Societies and ship operators and eventually by developing a Decision Support System for ship structures and machinery for continuous monitoring and risk analysis and management of ship operations.\n","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"c616f2ee01fac408bbbe2bb159a1a334","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/incass/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/incass/","section":"project","summary":"Inspection Capabilities for Enhanced Ship Safety","tags":["fp7"],"title":"INCASS","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Alberto Ortiz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543909,"objectID":"9a1f0603a41bdcc9080756d0178c0110","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/garcia-2013-probabilistic/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:29.491523Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2013-probabilistic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Probabilistic Appearance-based Mapping and Localization using Visual Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortiz","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543911,"objectID":"c3c5f640adc231a33e1934eaaed2c253","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/ortiz-2013-vessel/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:31.350699Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2013-vessel/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Vessel Inspection Assistance by means of a Micro-Aerial Vehicle: Control Architecture and Self-Localization Issues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Alberto Ortiz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543909,"objectID":"96bf402c2d706fcc2016223548ec4c8b","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/garcia-2012-control/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:28.951433Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2012-control/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Control Architecture for a Micro Aerial Vehicle Intended for Vessel Visual Inspection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortiz","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543911,"objectID":"a9ddbb8c7d023633454489f6169ea08e","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/ortiz-2012-micro/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:31.157881Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2012-micro/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Micro Aerial Vehicle for Vessel Visual Inspection Assistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Alberto Ortiz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543909,"objectID":"1a2f0f3ff0fbcc7e4cff226ff6cbd01c","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/bonnin-2012-semi/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:29.125736Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bonnin-2012-semi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Semi-Autonomous Visual Inspection of Vessels Assisted by an Unmanned Micro Aerial Vehicle","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Period: 2012 - 2015 \nGlobal Objectives The TRITON project proposes two scenarios as a proof of concept to demonstrate the developed capabilities: (1) the search and recovery of an object of interest (e.g. a black box) and (2) the intervention of an underwater panel in a permanent observatory. The first mission scenario will be divided in several sub-tasks. First, the mission will begin with the deployment of the AUV and the intervention I-AUV, which should then adopt and maintain a safe formation that enables acoustic communication and absolute positioning of both vehicles. Then, a sonar survey will be carried out by the AUV to detect the signal emitted by a pinger in the black box. The detection of such signal will be followed by a second survey, whose objective is to create a photomosaic of the area, making possible to visually identify the object. Finally, the AUV will be sent back to perform the intervention task to recover the object. The second mission scenario will also begin with the deployment and formation of both marine robots in order to establish communications and absolute positioning. Then, the AUV will use acoustics to interrogate a transponder mounted in the observatory with the objective to guide the vehicle transit to the panel. When visual contact with the objective is established, the AUV will approach the panel using visual servoing. The final part of the docking operation will involve a mechanism to rigidly attach the vehicle to the panel. After this, the manipulation will take place. Two demonstrative applications are foreseen: Opening/closing a valve, and connecting/disconnecting a cable.\nNeed for coordination and added value of the coordination The TRITON coordinated research project aims the use of autonomous vehicles to execute complex underwater intervention tasks. The project focuses on the coordinated operation of multiple vehicles executing a cooperative mission, on increasing the dexterity of the hand-arm system available in the I-AUV, and on the improvement of the sensorial capabilities needed in all stages of the missions. Accordingly, TRITON has been broken down into 3 subprojects: COMAROB, responsible for the cooperation of two marine robots; VISUAL2, in charge of the visual mapping and the optical object identification; and GRASPER, responsible for the multisensory based autonomous manipulation.\nSpecific Objectives of Each Subproject The “COMAROB” subproject (UdG) has three main goals: 1) to consolidate the systems developed so far, to safely bridge the gap between water tank experiments and open sea trials; 2) to extend the system’s architecture, currently being used for the NGC (navigation, guidance and control), obstacle avoidance, path planning and mission control of each vehicle, to enable cooperation among themselves; and 3) to carry out SLAM-based acoustic mapping while simultaneously using cooperative navigation for ground truth. The main goals assumed by the “GRASPER” subproject (UJI) will cover the main aspects related to the mission specification by the user and the process of robotic manipulation: (1) development of the user interface and simulation capabilities needed for the complete project, improving the initial interface developed through the previous project; (2) design and integration of a more capable hand-arm system than the previously developed within the RAUVI project. For this project, we aim to build a more advanced gripper that can be used for different tasks, and to improve the grasping/manipulation functionalities by means of a better multisensory integration; (3) development and application of new methods for underwater manipulation that go beyond the current state of the art. This task will be in charge of planning the intervention mission details and to perform them in realistic conditions. For that, a new grasp planner will be developed making use of range and visual information provided by the I-AUV sensors. The VISUAL2 subproject (UIB) will focus on: (1) enhancing the vehicle self-localization performance using SLAM-based strategies fed with stereo images and acoustic information, taking into account the special features of the underwater scenarios and the intended missions of TRITON; (2) development of 3D safe path planning algorithms and obstacle avoidance strategies; (3) development of a laser and video fusion framework to extract enhanced structural information of the scenes of interest and the objects to be manipulated.\n","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"386f713d70dd4116d02863a6b6a8a421","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/triton/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/triton/","section":"project","summary":"Multisensory Based Underwater Intervention through Cooperative Marine Robots","tags":["national"],"title":"TRITON","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortiz","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Joan P Beltran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543908,"objectID":"de29e56579626938bf02223be6819fe9","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/ortiz-2011-control/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:28.587023Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2011-control/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Control Software Architecture for Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles Inspired in Generic Components","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543910,"objectID":"bbdc49b9e56dcabc38a266a2303118a8","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/garcia-2011-experimental/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:30.416807Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2011-experimental/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Experimental Assessment of Different Image Descriptors for Topological Map-Building and Scene Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Ortiz","Francisco Bonnin-Pascual","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543908,"objectID":"4297cd8ea3445f306e6ddaa0c6c42ea1","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/ortiz-2011-use/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:28.766437Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ortiz-2011-use/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"On the Use of UAVs for Vessel Inspection Assistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julià Amer","Daniel Böerner","Josep Campins","Daniel Gándara","Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo","Luis Lapresa","Silvia Ramis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543910,"objectID":"cf8375a44cb129f502b24b31380894dd","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/amer-2009-integracion/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:30.774266Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amer-2009-integracion/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Integración de Imágenes Electrocardiográficas en el Servicion de Salud de las Islas Baleares","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Period: 2009 - 2012 \nThe increasing competitiveness in marine operations creates a need for new system concepts that introduce high technology value added products, facilitate the processes involved and minimize the downtimes. The need, thus, lies not only in incorporating the technological means so far available, but in changing the way the corresponding authorities stand against the challenges at hand.\nMINOAS project proposes reengineering of the overall vessel-inspection methodology, by introducing an innovative system concept that incorporates state of the art technologies, but at the same time formulates a new standardization of the overall inspection process. Through holistic approach, MINOAS proposes the development of a new infrastructure that substitutes human personnel by high locomotion enabled robots and \u0026ldquo;teleports\u0026rdquo; the human inspector from the vessel\u0026rsquo;s hold to a control room with virtual reality properties. The human\u0026rsquo;s perceptual abilities are enhanced through the utilization of high resolution tools (eg. sensors) and are augmented through the parallel processing property provided by MINOAS. Following the centralized control scheme adopted in similar distributed control methodologies (SCADA), the number and the sequence of the tasks required is rearranged and the overall inspection procedure is brought in alignment with the current tendency adopted in similar inspection, exploration and surveillance tasks.\nThe proposed innovative system concept, considers the assembly of a robot fleet with advanced locomotion abilities and sets of tools that are dedicated to the tasks attached to the inspection process, the development of control techniques and algorithms that provide a semi-autonomous nature to the operation of the robot-fleet and a hierarchical controller that realize the virtual environment for the human inspector and adds newly developed toolboxes enabling on-line processing of the harvested data and operate as a Decision Support System in the aid of the inspector.\n  ","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"077eac1e69774dcdc358f8e21ee88e57","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/project/minoas/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/minoas/","section":"project","summary":"Marine Inspection Robotic Assistant Systems","tags":["fp7"],"title":"MINOAS","type":"project"},{"authors":["Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601543911,"objectID":"60265a8eb3d3c8f5c7d26498e82ce65b","permalink":"https://emiliofidalgo.github.io/publication/garcia-2007-implantacion/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T09:18:30.968217Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garcia-2007-implantacion/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Implantación de un Sensor Sónar para el Control de la Navegación de un Vehı́culo Submarino","type":"publication"}]
